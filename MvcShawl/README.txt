Before Starting anything I am creating a repository and pushing this default project to it. 


1628
Perfect! I've got a git repo made and have shared it with all teammates.
Now to start by changing the title to our fictional company name "Quite Good Shawls"

1636
Now that I am done thinking of an amazing name and adding it to the header of the site. I need to make the model for our item and scaffold

1639
I've got a simple model made now which means I can make seeding data and create the scaffolding

1651
I scaffolded the shawlsController and then hooked the seedData up to it
Which means I should be able to have my web app title link to the catalogue

1703
After adding the initialcreate migration and updating the db I am able to route to the 
/Shawls URL manually, time to link the title to that page.

Before I do anything I am going to commit and push my progress now that I am done the inital database work
****I have a server instance of ProjectModels in my sql object explorer. I changed the connection string in appsettings so change the string if you have db problems******
****

1709
Alright now its time to create some seed data and link the title to catalogue

1727
I have made the title link to my catalogue and created my seed data. 
Now I have to make sure the seed data will be taken into account on project initalize

1734
The seed data is filling up the catalogue when I route to it now! Now I will push to the github once again.

1738
Now with the project pushed to the github again I am going to take a small break but whats next is 
to find a suitable logo for our shawl company and then create the content for an "About Us" page.
After that should just be making sure the external gtihub 'README.md' is filled with the required information and then done!


1945
I grabbed a logo and made a quick about us page.
Now all that should be left for the prototype should be a readme in the github repo with overview info about the project.


1957
I messed around with the about us page a little more and added some styling
Now to do the final test, then if good the final commit. 
Then I will complete the README.md within github
