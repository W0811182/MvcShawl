Before Starting anything I am creating a repository and pushing this default project to it. 


1628
Perfect! I've got a git repo made and have shared it with all teammates.
Now to start by changing the title to our fictional company name "Quite Good Shawls"

1636
Now that I am done thinking of an amazing name and adding it to the header of the site. I need to make the model for our item and scaffold

1639
I've got a simple model made now which means I can make seeding data and create the scaffolding

1651
I scaffolded the shawlsController and then hooked the seedData up to it
Which means I should be able to have my web app title link to the catalogue

After adding the initialcreate migration and updating the db I am able to route to the 
/Shawls URL manually, time to link the title to that page.

Before I do anything I am going to commit and push my progress now that I am done the inital database work
****I have a server instance of ProjectModels in my sql object explorer. I changed the connection string in appsettings so change the string if you have db problems******
