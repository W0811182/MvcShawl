    <h2>Where Are We?</h2>
    <p>
        Our headquarters is located in a cozy little corner of the fashion world—
        <strong>Shawl City, Fabricland</strong>.
        It’s a magical place where soft fabrics, stylish patterns, and slightly eccentric designers
        come together to create shawls that are *almost too good*.
